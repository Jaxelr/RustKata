# Rust samples and test projects

I'm learning Rust and using this repository to store samples read from articles and test projects I've made on my own initiative.

## Attributions

Each sample has a reference to the article or book I've read to learn about the topic, is that was the case. I'm also using the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as a reference on multiple instances.
